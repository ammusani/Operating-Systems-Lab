Question: c

I have used 5 semaphores and whenever a philospher goes to eat and nearby chopsticks are free he can easily eat it, else he will go into wait state untill both the nearby chopsticks don't get free.
To handle the deadlock I have choose wait semaphores in such a way that always two chopsticks are chosen at once and if one is already taken it won't allow other to take the other.
